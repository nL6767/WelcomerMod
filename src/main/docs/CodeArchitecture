================================================================================

[PLAYER JOINS]
       |
       v
  Chat Listener / JOIN Event
       |
       +--> statsManager.onPlayerJoin(name)   (always tracked)
       +--> if (self-greet enabled) greetSelfWithCooldown()
       +--> if (welcomer enabled & not ignored) greetPlayer(name)

[PLAYER LEAVES]
       |
       v
  Chat Listener / LEAVE Event
       |
       +--> statsManager.onPlayerLeave(name)  (accumulate time)
       +--> write stats to file (periodically via scheduler or on disconnect)

[GREETING LOGIC]
       |
       v
  Scheduler + Message Queues
       |
       +--> allMessages loaded from config / jar
       +--> messageQueue (shuffled)
       +--> selfMessageQueue (shuffled)
       +--> greetPlayer(name) / greetSelfWithCooldown() send chat

[COMMANDS (/welcomer ...)]
       |
       +--> toggle            (enable/disable greetings)
       +--> selfgreet toggle  (enable/disable self-greet)
       +--> ignore <player>   (add to ignoredPlayers)
       +--> unignore <player> (remove from ignoredPlayers)
       +--> stats <player>    (show stats locally)
       +--> stats top         (show top playtime locally)
       +--> print stats <player/top> (send stats publicly)
       +--> config reload/add (update messages)

[STATS & FILES]
       |
       +--> playerJoinTimes / playerTimePlayed / greetingCounts / ignoredPlayers
       +--> periodic tick every 1 sec updates playtime
       +--> writeStatsToFile() → welcomer_stats.txt
       +--> ignorePlayer() / unignorePlayer() → welcomer_ignore.txt
       +--> loadStatsFromFile() / loadSinglePlayerFromDisk() for persistence

[NOTES]
  - Stats always tracked regardless of greeting toggle
  - Ignored players are excluded from greetings and stats tracking
  - Self-greet is independent of the main enable toggle
