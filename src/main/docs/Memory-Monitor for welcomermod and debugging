/**
 * WelcomerMemoryMonitor – Client-Side Memory Monitoring Tool
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Tracks memory usage of key Welcomer objects in real time.
 * - Logs JVM memory usage and approximate memory usage of tracked objects.
 * - Helps detect memory leaks or growth patterns in the mod.
 *
 * Core Features:
 * 1. Waits for WelcomerMod and PlayerStatsManager to be fully initialized.
 * 2. Tracks only essential objects:
 *      - WelcomerMod instance
 *      - PlayerStatsManager instance
 * 3. Estimates object size recursively for common collections:
 *      - Lists, Maps, Sets, arrays, Strings
 * 4. Logs memory usage every 5 seconds to:
 *      - Console (System.out)
 *      - File (config/welcomer_memory_log.txt)
 *
 * Fields:
 * - client: MinecraftClient instance.
 * - trackedObjects: List<Object> of objects to monitor memory.
 * - logFile: Path for memory log file.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - estimateObjectSize(Object obj):
 *      Estimates memory usage recursively for an object and its children.
 *
 * Notes / Best Practices:
 * - Estimations are approximate, not JVM precise.
 * - Only tracks Welcomer-specific objects to avoid overhead.
 * - Uses a dedicated thread for monitoring; does not block client main thread.
 * - Handles log file creation and appending safely.
