1. Overview

Welcomer is a client-side Minecraft mod that:
- Automatically greets players when they join your server.
- Tracks player join/leave sessions and playtime.
- Maintains greeting counts for each player.
- Provides commands to customize behavior and manage stats.
- Allows self-greetings with configurable cooldown.
- Provides memory tracking for debugging (optional, internal).

Key Features:

- Join/Leave tracking for all players, even if greetings are disabled.
- Greeting messages loaded from config/welcomer_messages.txt.
- Ignore players from greetings and stats with /welcomer ignore.
- Persistent stats stored in config/welcomer_stats.txt.
- Leaderboards via /welcomer stats top and /welcomer print stats top.

2. Commands

All commands are client-side only and start with /welcomer.

/welcomer toggle            → Enable/disable greetings (Default: OFF)
/welcomer selfgreet toggle  → Enable/disable self-greet (5 min cooldown)
/welcomer status            → Show current toggle states




2.1 Ignore / Unignore Players
/welcomer ignore <player>
/welcomer unignore <player>


Ignores a player for greetings and stats tracking.
Persists ignore list to config/welcomer_ignore.txt.


2.2 Player Stats

/welcomer stats <player>    → Show greets & time online with you
/welcomer stats top         → Top 10 players by time online

...

2.3 Print Stats to Chat
/welcomer print stats <player>
/welcomer print stats top


Sends stats publicly in the chat instead of client-only overlay.

/top version prints top 3 players with a 1.8s staggered delay between messages.

2.4 Config Management
/welcomer config reload
Reloads welcome messages from config/welcomer_messages.txt.

/welcomer config add <message>
Adds a new welcome message to welcomer_messages.txt.

Example:
/welcomer config add Welcome %s to the server!
Supports %s placeholder for player names.

3. Player Tracking Details
Always Tracked: Join/Leave events are tracked even when Welcomer is OFF.

Ignored Players: /welcomer ignore <player> prevents:
- Greetings
- Playtime tracking
- Stats counting
- Playtime: Counts the milliseconds a player is online while your client is connected.
- Greets: Only recorded when the player is greeted via Welcomer.


4. Self-Greet Behavior
- Self-greet messages rotate randomly from a predefined list.
- Uses 5-minute cooldown.
- Example self-greet messages:
- "Hello everyone!"
- "I arrived!"
- "Wow, I'm here!"


5. Configuration Files
- config/welcomer_messages.txt → Stores custom welcome messages.
- config/welcomer_stats.txt → Stores persistent stats per player.
- config/welcomer_ignore.txt → Stores ignored player names.
- These files are auto-created on first run if missing.


6. Memory Monitoring (Internal)
- Optional debug tool: WelcomerMemoryMonitor.
- Logs JVM and tracked object memory usage every 5 seconds.
- Writes to config/welcomer_memory_log.txt.
- Only tracks WelcomerMod and PlayerStatsManager objects.


7. Tips & Notes
Default State: Greeting features are OFF to prevent spam. Stats tracking is always active.
Thread-Safe: All stats operations are synchronized.
Staggered printing: Prevents chat spam when printing top players publicly.
File Persistence: All changes (ignore list, stats, messages) are persisted immediately
